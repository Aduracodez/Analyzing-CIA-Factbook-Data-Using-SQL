# Analyzing-CIA-Factbook-Data-Using-SQL
## Overview
This project aims to analyze data from the CIA World Factbook using SQL. The CIA World Factbook provides a comprehensive collection of information about countries worldwide, including demographic, economic, geographic, and social data.

By leveraging SQL queries, this project allows users to extract valuable insights from the Factbook's extensive dataset. It provides a structured approach to querying and analyzing the data, enabling users to perform various types of analysis and answer specific questions about countries and their attributes.

# Features
The project offers the following features:

SQL Queries: The project provides a set of SQL queries tailored to the CIA Factbook dataset. These queries allow users to retrieve specific information from the database, filter data based on conditions, perform calculations, and aggregate results.

Data Exploration: Users can explore the data by executing predefined SQL queries to retrieve general information about countries, such as population, area, and capital cities. This feature helps users gain a better understanding of the dataset and the available attributes.

Comparative Analysis: The project enables users to compare countries based on various criteria. Users can use SQL queries to compare countries' population, GDP, literacy rates, or any other available attribute. This feature helps in identifying trends, differences, and similarities among countries.

Statistical Analysis: Users can perform statistical calculations on the data, such as calculating averages, minimum and maximum values, and performing basic arithmetic operations. This allows for a deeper analysis of the dataset and the extraction of meaningful insights.

Advanced Queries: The project supports advanced SQL queries, including subqueries, joins, and grouping. These features enable users to perform complex analysis tasks, such as finding countries with specific characteristics or combining data from multiple tables for comprehensive analysis.

Custom Queries: Users can create their own SQL queries to extract specific information or answer unique questions based on their requirements. The project provides a flexible framework to execute custom queries on the CIA Factbook data.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Obtain the CIA Factbook Dataset: Download the CIA World Factbook dataset in a format compatible with your preferred SQL database system. Ensure that the data is properly imported into your database.

Connect to the Database: Establish a connection to your SQL database using a suitable client or interface.

Execute Predefined Queries: Utilize the provided predefined SQL queries to explore and analyze the data. Modify the queries as per your specific analysis requirements.

Customize and Create New Queries: If needed, create your own SQL queries to extract additional information or perform specific analysis tasks.

# Requirements
